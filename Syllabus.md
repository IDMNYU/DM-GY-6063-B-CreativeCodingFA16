# Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding
2 Metrotech Center Room 811
6:30pm - 9:20pm Monday


This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity.  Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result.  In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly.  By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations,  graphical user interfaces, games and user interfaces.  Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.

## Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program Objectives by

Develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.

Develop technical skills to realize their ideas.

Develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

Gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

Develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

## Course Objectives

Students in this course will:

• Understand the basics of creative coding in Java & Javascript (Processing/p5.js).
• Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
• Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework.
• Experiment with different techniques for user input and output, including sensors and non-traditional screens.
• Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

## Prerequisites

This course presumes no prior knowledge of programming. It does assume a high degree of computer literacy. We will learn about programming in a platform-generic way.


## Assessment

Assessment will occur by reviewing weekly coding assignments, challenges, and  projects. The course is cumulative.  Please see the Grading Section for specific grade breakdown, calendar for due dates, and assignments for briefs. 

The assignments are your opportunity to put your skills to the test. They're designed to test and deepen your knowledge while giving me valuable information about how you're progressing in the class. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRtV-ugIT0k">Finished is better than perfect. </a> An attempt at them is better than nothing at all. 

Students will evaluate their own progressed in a course in two ways: 1) A course evaluation form, which will be developed based on the course’s individual objectives. 2) Students will participate in a self reflection assignment due Week 7 & Week 15 or as otherwise noted. 

• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result. 

• Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

Week 15 only: 
• Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming


## Course Requirements

• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the github account for the class at least once a week for up to date information 

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Acquire and keep up with all of the readings. Read all assigned readings before class.

• Devote at a minimum 8 to 12 hours a week OUTSIDE of class, fulfilling homework assignments, readings and studying concepts covered in class, in order to do average.

• Have Patience, Persistence, and Discipline

• Be Creative

• Pay attention to Detail & Craft

• Have Self-confidence and Pride in your work

• Take Risks & be Fearless in your assignments

• Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t let your failures determine you. Rise again.

## Attendance

Attendance is important to this course for multiple reasons. Quite a bit of material is covered in each class. In addition, class is seen as a community to support and to develop ideas and learning.

Missing more than 2 classes may result in a decreased letter grade. Three or more absences are grounds for dismissal from the course. Absences can have a deeply negative impact on your grade, especially if you are struggling. Please manage your time appropriately.

If you have compelling personal/professional reasons to be missing a class (presenting/attending a conference, having a show, wedding, etc), please let me know 2 weeks in advance to have it possibly excused.

If you are contagious or incapacitated, please let me know by email/dm on slack before class begins.

• All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects your grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not. Critiques can not be made up.

• Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.

• Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. Check the GitHub. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.

## Contacting Me
[Slack](https://gradcreativecodingb.slack.com) Direct Message is the preferred initial contact. Otherwise you may email me (katherine.bennett@nyu.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an appointment during office hours. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.

## Course Structure

Class will be a mix of lectures, class discussion, Show & Tell, workshops/challenges, studio time and critiques. Guest critics may be present.

The course can be broken down into 3 sections throughout the semester: programming basics, Object Orientated Programming (OOP), and advance topics (automation/behaviors, using addons - JSON, API’s, Arduino, Computer Vision, Sound, etc). The latter 3rd of the semester will be devoted to student interests and project needs.


## Important Aspects of this Course


GitHub is a web hosting service that supports Git version control. It is more important than your resume, whether you are an artist or designer. It’s used largerly for software, but can be used for anything. It’s important to become familar with it, develop good habits (it’s like Time Machine, but better). See the assigned reading links for more information.

• **Time** Time management is everything. You will need it to have reasonable accomplishments in this class. The material is cumulative. The readings are essential. Writing code is the only way to make progress and to fully synthesize the material. It becomes evident quite quickly. Develop excellent time management. You will need 8-15 hours outside of class to succeed.  

• Projects are not always group projects.

• **Using code found elsewhere** It's super easy to find code online. As tempting as this is, I am going to ask that you write your own code for the first 2/3 of the semester. This will help you grasp and retain the fundamentals. It does help to write the code from the book out, line by line. Code that  is not written by you can not be submitted as a homework assignment, project or pair programming challenge as your own work. 

If you use code from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to site the work and author, as well as to comment each line. In these cases, I am looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. Also, not more 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere.

If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as cheating, and you will fail the assigment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

## How to Submit Assignments via GitHub


Do the follow these steps for each assignment:

	1. Use a text editor to create the appropriate files - "index.html" and "sketch.js" OR "firstNameAssignment#.pde"
	2. Save them in a folder titled: firstNameAssignment#, with the number of the assignment.
	3. Create a new repository on your GitHub account online. The repository should be titled CC_Ex#, filling in the number of the exercise. Include the README.md option
	4. Make me a collaborator on this repository. My Github handle is LadyK.
	5. Upload your folder. This file should contain all of the supporting files and documents.
	6. Under the "Issues" tab, create a new issue. Note what bugs you are having, or where help is needed. Copy and paste the specific code in the comment area. Label the issue accordingly.

## Grading

• Self-Assessments (Tickets to Leave, Midterm & Final)		10%

• Participation 		5%

• In-class challenges   5%

• Exercises	            30%

• Project 1: Adjective (critiqued)		20%

• Project 2: Choice (critiqued)			30%

For each project your grade will be assessed upon the following: Principles, Creativity/Thoughtfulness, Craft. Below gives you a sense of the spectrum, giving examples for high, middle and low grades.

Please note: 
A letter grade of "C" is an average grade. Average is not bad. It means average. Most of us are average, in some way. An average level of work is being done. It does not mean perfection. It means that the work still has room to develop at it's current state. It also means that the work has noticible achievements and evidence of some acquisition of knowledge. I look at this on an individual basis as well as across the whole class. 

Please read examples of each assessment point below to get an idea of my expectations. Note that a "B" is between Satisificatory and Superior.	

### Principles:

• Superior - A - Your work shows evidence and understanding of programming concepts discussed in readings, lectures, and exercises, as you bend them to your will.

• Satisifactory - C - Your work shows evidence of concepts and is still developing an understanding of course material. You understand some aspects, but aren’t utilizing them fully. Usage is cursory. Keep pushing your work and review the material to revisit how you can integrate it to your work.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work shows some evidence of concepts discussed, but lacks key understanding, confidence, robustness and authority. Aspects are lacking. Reviewing course material is required. Ask questions in class. Manage your time better.

### Creativity, Thoughtfulness:

• Superior - A - Your work demonstrates your personality and a great depth of engagement with the material. It’s extremely evident that you are thinking, exploring, playing and taking risks. You are creating wonderful experiences.

• Satisifactory - C - You are executing your ideas, but more time is needed to consider more deeply about what is conceptually and physically happening. They are barely getting off the ground. Or have large bits that are broken. Do more research and exploring. Play.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work is so straightforward that it’s flat. It’s barely coded (or badly broken). It’s copied from elsewhere and not expanded upon. Question and Iterate your work to push your it further. Read. Play. Get off the lame track and get inspired.

### Craft:

• Superior - A - Your work shows delicate care and consideration to presentation and professionalism. You code is neat, clean, commented and structured. Your friends consider you “Type A.” Your style is evident.

• Satisifactory - C - Your work shows the birth of your ideas, but further time and iteration can really push your work to excel. Your code is there, but messy. It can be simplified and made cleaner. What you put into it, is what you get out of it. Practice makes perfect!

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work is rushed and looks like it was done on your train-ride in or the night before. Make your work something you are proud of. You are here to build your portfolio after all, aren’t you?


## Participation will be based upon: Professionalism, Engagement, and Improvement


### Professionalism:

• Superior - A - Always arrives on time; assignments turned in properly and on time; respectful of others in class and gives feedback appropriately.

• Satisifactory - C - Usually arrives on time; most assignments turned in on time; listens to others.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Often tardy; turns in assignments late; fails to prepare for class; in attentive to instructor or other students


### Engagement:

• Superior - A - Always contributes appropriately to class discussion; frequently offers to demonstrate technique; shows leadership in group projects.

• Satisifactory - C - Usually contributes to class discussion; has demonstrated technique; participates actively in group projects.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Does not participate in class discussion; no evidence of technique; fails to contribute adequately to group projects. 



### Improvement:

• Superior - A - Shows an exceptional and growing understanding of technique; builds on previous lessons; accepts critique and makes proper adjustments.

• Satisifactory - C - Technique is developing; has shown some ability to build on previous lessons; generally able to accept critique.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Little or no development of technique; is unable or unwilling to accept critique; unable to make adjustments.


### Late Work
Unless specified, work is due the BEFORE following class period.

Work that is turned in after class but still on the due date get's 1/3 letter grade deduction. Work that is turned in the same week, get's 2/3 grade deduction. Subsequent submissions get one letter grade deduction for ever week that it is late, beyond the first week. The lowest possible grade a late assignment will be given, will be an "F". Deductions are calculated AFTER the initial grade is given.

Assignments that are not submitted will receive a "0". Please realize that a "0" mark is a fantastic way to tank your grade.

You have 2 "get out of jail" pass for 2 exercises. Those exercises will be omitted from your overall "Exercises" Grade. If you complete all the exercies and do not use your get-out-of-jail pass, the extra exercise will be considered extra credit for your "Exercise" Grade.

### The numerical breakdown for letter grades is as follows:

• A	100-90		Excellent

• B	89-80		Very Good/Good

• C	79-70		Satisfactory

• D	69-63		Poor; Below Average

• F	63 & below	Unacceptable

## Technology in the Classroom

Please respect class time and the contact with me, your professor. When I say laptops down, I expect laptops to be closed and your attention focused on the presentation and class discussion. Utilize your phones only on break. Keep your phones on silent otherwise. If you absolutely need to take a call, please excuse yourself from class.The quality of the class depends in large part on the quality of your attention and active participation. In particular, give me and your fellow students the respect deserved. Give your full attention when students are presenting work and while I am going through lectures and demos. Continued use of cell phones or social networking sites during class time are a distraction. Students that are not respectful of class time will be asked to leave class. 

<a href = "https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.ong79i9mw"> And it's not just me. Read Clay Shirky's thoughts on students & laptops in the classroom. </a>

Course material missed is their own responsibility to cover, make-up and address. It is not the Professor’s.


## Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html">NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy</a> in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference.
